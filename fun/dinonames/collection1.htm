      <td> Dinosaur Hall at Carnegie Museum of Natural History has eleven different 
        species of dinosaur on display. <em>Triceratops</em> is just one of the 
        fascinating fossil animals you will see at Carnegie Museum of Natural 
        History, the "Home of the Dinosaurs." </p>

          <em><b>Triceratops</b></em> <br>
          Rather than an entire skeleton, Carnegie Museum of Natural History displays 
          only the skull of a <em>Triceratops</em>. Hundreds of <em>Triceratops</em> 
          skulls have been found throughout western North America&#8212;in the 
          states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and South Dakota, and in the Canadian 
          provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The <em>Triceratops</em> skull 
          in Dinosaur Hall was found in eastern Montana in 1904 and was collected 
          by Carnegie Museum paleontologist W.H. Utterback. </p>
        <p>Carnegie Museum's <em>Triceratops</em> skull is about 6 feet 3 inches 
          long, an average size for this type of dinosaur. The largest skull known, 
          8 feet long, is mounted on a skeleton exhibited in the American Museum 
          of Natural History in New York. The skull itself is huge, but can you 
          imagine how enormous <em>Triceratops</em> was in "flesh and blood"?
