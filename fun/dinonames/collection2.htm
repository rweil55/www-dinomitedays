<em><b>Tyrannosaurus Rex</b></em>
<br>
          Carnegie Museum of Natural History has two <i>T. rex</i> skeletons on 
          display. The first <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> ever found was discovered at 
          Hell Creek in eastern Montana by a field party from the American Museum 
          of Natural History in New York. When the skeleton was excavated, most 
          of the neck vertebrae, the front feet, and the tail were missing. The 
          <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> skeleton was purchased for Carnegie Museum in 
          1941 and put on display the following year. </p>
        <p> A second <i>T. rex</i> was put on display 
          at Carnegie Museum in late 1997 and moved to the Pittsburgh airport 
          in 2002. This new specimen now greets visitors from all over the world.
