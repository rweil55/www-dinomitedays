      <td> Dinosaur Hall at Carnegie Museum of Natural History has eleven different 
        species of dinosaur on display. <em>Corythosaurus</em> is just one of 
        the fascinating fossil animals you will see at Carnegie Museum of Natural 
        History, the "Home of the Dinosaurs." </p>

<em><b>Corythosaurus</b></em>

<br><em>Corythosaurus</em> lived in a marshy, semi-tropical forest area that once 
covered western portions of Canada and the United States. Today we call what remains of this 
area the Oldman Formation. More individual dinosaur 
specimens have been found in the Oldman Formation than in any other 
geological formation in the world. At Carnegie Museum of Natural History you 
will see <em>Corythosaurus</em> much as it was found in 1920.

</p>
        <p>On your next visit to the museum, notice the size of <em>Corythosaurus</em>. 
          Carnegie Museum of Natural History's specimen is small in comparison 
          to other <em>Corythosaurus</em> specimens. Other <em>Corythosaurus</em> 
          skeletons range up to twice its size. </td>
