      <td> Dinosaur Hall at Carnegie Museum of Natural History has eleven different 
        species of dinosaur on display. <em>Stegosaurus</em> is just one of the 
        fascinating fossil animals you will see at Carnegie Museum of Natural 
        History, the "Home of the Dinosaurs." </p>

<em><b>Stegosaurus</b></em><br>
The bones of the <em>Stegosaurus</em> skeleton on display in Dinosaur Hall come from more than one 
<em>Stegosaurus</em>. Often scientists cannot find all the bones from one dinosaur, so 
they use bones from different animals to build a single 
skeleton. Sometimes they never find all the bones that belong in a skeleton, so they have to guess 
what some parts of the animal looked like. 

</p>
        <p>Our skeleton is made up of several <em>Stegosaurus</em> skeletons from 
          the Morrison Formation. This formation of rocks, named after a town 
          in Colorado, is 140 million years old and contains many fossilized dinosaur 
          bones. These bones were found in coarse sandstone that was once sand 
          in an ancient river that flowed when the dinosaurs were living there&#8212;long 
          before the mountains now in that area existed. </p>
        <p>A museum paleontologist, Earl Douglass, found the <em>Stegosaurus</em> 
bones in 1915, and the skeleton was put on exhibit in 1940. At that time, scientists had to guess 
what <em>Stegosaurus' </em>  hind feet looked like because they did not have a complete set of bones. 
Since then, scientists at Carnegie Museum of Natural History have found a complete hind foot 
of <em>Stegosaurus</em>. We now know that <em>Stegosaurus</em> had three large toes and a 
fourth one that could barely be seen.
