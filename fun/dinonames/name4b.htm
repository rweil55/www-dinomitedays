<em><b>Stegosaurus</b></em> 

<br><em>Stegosaurus</em> <a href="../wav/stegosaurus.wav">(steg-o-SORE-us)</a> was one dinosaur that spent much of its time devouring large quantities of plants to fuel its huge body. With its 
plated back and spiked tail, <em>Stegosaurus</em> was one strange looking animal!

Scientists aren't sure why <em>Stegosaurus</em> had plates on its back. 
Some scientists believe they were there for protection. Others think the plates may have helped 
<em>Stegosaurus</em> control its body temperature.
<p>The name <em>Stegosaurus</em> comes from the Greek words for "covered lizard."
