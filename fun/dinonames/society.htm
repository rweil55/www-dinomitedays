      <p> With an average length of nearly 40 feet and a weight estimated at six 
        and a half tons, <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> was one big animal! However, 
        bigger isn't always better. Although it towered over most dinosaurs, <em>T. 
        rex'</em>s humongous size posed problems. 
      <p> <em>T. rex</em>'s movement was limited by its dino-girth. It wasn't 
        exactly a speed demon. Its maximum velocity was about 20 m.p.h., comparable 
        to that of today's land giant, the African elephant. 
      <p> Size and weight also made <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> a clumsy beast. The 
        dinosaur could easily lose its balance when moving at a high speed. Its 
        tiny front arms weren't enough to stabilize a freefalling <em>rex</em>, 
        and it was in great danger of fracturing its heavy skull if it fell. It 
        could also easily be knocked off balance by struggling prey. 
      <p> Some paleontologists suggest that the difficulty in capturing prey negates 
        the classic interpretation of <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> as a predatory 
        animal. They suggest that the huge carnivore was a scavenger, surviving 
        on the remains of animals that were already dead. The answer may lie somewhere 
        between the two extremes. <em>T. rex</em> may have indeed been a predator, 
        but only took sick or weak animals that didn't put up much of a fight. 
      <p> However, it is highly likely that the tyrant king wasn't above taking 
        it easy and making a hearty meal of a carcass whenever it could. It's 
        a shame that <em>T. rex</em> was felled by extinction&#8212;American highways 
        would have provided a coast-to-coast buffet! </font></td>
