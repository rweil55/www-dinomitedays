Nice work! You have correctly identified <em>Allosaurus</em> <a href="../wav/allosaurus.wav">(al-o-SORE-us)</a>, a large meat-eating theropod. 
<br><br><em>Allosaurus</em> was one of the biggest meat-eating dinosaurs of its time. It weighed much 
less than the huge plant-eating dinosaurs it fed on, but it had a huge mouth and curved teeth up 
to 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. The front and back of each of <em>Allosaurus'</em> teeth were lined with 
tiny serrations like a steak knife. With these teeth, <em>Allosaurus</em> could slice through skin and 
flesh with ease.
<br><br>Footprints left by <em>Allosaurus</em> show it walked on powerful hind limbs, taking 
six-and-one-half-foot strides. <em>Allosaurus'</em> powerful leg muscles also allowed it to leap at 
its victims.

<br><br>Notice the open spaces in <em>Allosaurus'</em> skull. These reduced the weight of the skull 
but not its strength. They allowed <em>Allosaurus</em> to have such a huge (and dangerous) head.
