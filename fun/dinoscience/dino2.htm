<b>It was one of the largest dinosaurs that walked on two feet. When it was alive, 
it probably weighed about 7 and a half tons (7500 kg). </p><p>This dinosaur had huge hind legs and hips that supported its gigantic body. Judging from the size of these legs, it seems that the animal walked slowly, rocking from side to side. Its front legs were tiny and were not used for walking. Perhaps they were used to hold its prey.</b>
