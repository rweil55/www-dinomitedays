Nice work! You have correctly identified <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> <a href="../wav/trex.wav">(tie-RAN-a-sore-us REX)</a>.
<br><br><em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> was probably a fearsome-looking animal. <em>T. rex's</em> skull alone measures 
4 feet (1.2 m) long, but many large openings reduced its weight. The jaws of <em>Tyrannosaurus 
rex</em> were lined with dagger-shaped teeth, each of which were up to 6 inches (15 cm) long. The edges of <em>T. rex's</em> teeth were serrated like a steak knife, and these serrations made <em>T. rex's</em> teeth extremely effective at slicing through flesh.
<br><br>As its name suggests, <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> was probably ferocious. Its massive teeth and strong jaw muscles were probably no match for an unarmored duck-bill dinosaur. While ripping off pieces of flesh with its jaws, <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> might have used its hind feet to hold down its victim.
