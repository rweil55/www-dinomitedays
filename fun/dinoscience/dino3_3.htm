Nice work! You have correctly identified <em>Corythosaurus</em> <a href="../wav/corythosaurus.wav">(kor-ith-a-SORE-us)</a>. 
<br><br>Many millions of years ago, <em>Corythosaurus</em> roamed the swamps that covered western North America. 
With no armor to protect itself, it was probably easy prey for the large meat-eating dinosaurs of 
the time.
<br><br><em>Corythosaurus</em> belonged to a group sometimes called the duck-billed dinosaurs. They were 
called this because their horny, squared-off beaks look very much like the bills of ducks. 
<em>Corythosaurus</em> would grasp a mouthful of leaves, fruit, or water plants in its mouth; 
then it would clamp its flat bill shut and strip the food from the plant. Although <em>Corythosaurus</em> 
had no teeth in front of its mouth, the back of each jaw was lined with rows of up to 2,000 tightly packed  teeth. <em>Corythosaurus</em> used these teeth to grind up tough plants. As old teeth wore and fell out, new ones grew in to replace them.

<br><br>If you look closely, you can see that <em>Corythosaurus</em> had a bony crest on top of its 
skull. Paleontologists (scientists who study fossils) aren't sure why <em>Corythosaurus</em> 
had this crest, but they have some ideas: Inside the crest there are air passages. 
These passages may have given <em>Corythosaurus</em> a sharp sense of smell to help it detect 
predators. Maybe the crest was brightly colored and helped <em>Corythosaurus</em> 
to attract a mate. Recent studies suggest that the air passages in the crest may have given 
<em>Corythosaurus</em> a loud cry that it used to communicate with other dinosaurs. Imagine the 
racket they might have made!
