<b>Scientists who study fossils are rarely able to find complete dinosaur 
skeletons. This is especially true of the gigantic plant-eating dinosaurs, which were 
commonly found without skulls. In order to complete a skeleton, scientists sometimes put 
together fossil bones from different animals of the same species. Sometimes, however, they 
make mistakes. In fact, the Carnegie Museum of Natural 
History, like many other museums, displayed the <em>Apatosaurus</em> you 
see below with the wrong skull for many years.

<b> Scientists are continuously testing their theories, however, and they were 
eventually able to piece together the correct skeleton by reexamining the original 
evidence. <br>
<br>On the following pages, you will find some of Carnegie Museum's dinosaurs without their heads. 
Test your knowledge of dinosaur anatomy by matching the skeletons with their skulls.
