The theropods were a group of carnivorous (meat-eating) dinosaurs that walked on two legs.
They typically had hollow bones, a short neck, long powerful legs, and clawed feet.
<br><br>The theropods lived in many different parts of the world and existed for many millions 
of years. In fact, a small group of them may have evolved into birds. 
<br><br>You can recognize many theropod skulls by their sharp, pointed teeth.
