half a century it’s towered over visitors in the Hall of Dinosaurs at Carnegie 
Museum of Natural History, rearing up on immense hind legs and filling young and 
old with awe and a little fear. Once you’ve stood in its shadow, you don’t question 
the existence of dinosaurs, or the extent of their size, or their potential ferocity. 
But around the country, natural history museums—including the Carnegie—are rethinking 
the way they’ve been displaying <i>T. rex</i> all these decades, and many have 
repositioned their specimens into a more horizontal stance. 
<P>"This new posture doesn’t mean museums were wrong all these years about <i>T. 
  rex</i>," says Mary Dawson, curator emeritus of Vertebrate Paleontology at Carnegie 
  Museum of Natural History, in reference to the previously accepted vertical 
  posture. "Paleontologists have simply begun looking at <i>T. rex</i> more as 
  a living, moving animal than as a static museum trophy." Indeed, the horizontal 
  posture reflects what scientists now see as <i>T. rex</i>’s likely locomotive 
  posture, but Dawson says the animal could very well have assumed the older, 
  vertical position when at rest. 
<P>A new cast of <i>T. rex</i>, in the active, horizontal stance, was assembled 
  over the summer of 1997 by museum staff in the Hall of Sculpture, and it will 
  remain on display at Pittsburgh International Airport. Museum visitors were 
  able to watch as the new <i>T. rex</i> took shape over two months, vertebrae 
  by vertebrae and rib by rib. 
<P>The specimen was purchased by the museum from Research Casting International, 
  which cast it from an original <i>T. rex</i> at the Museum of the Rockies in 
  Bozeman, Montana. Norman Wuerthele, manager of the museum’s preparation laboratory, 
  and preparator Richard Kissel, assembled the specimen and positioned it according 
  to the latest scientific information. 
<P>"Even though the cast came with the legs and pelvis already put together, assembling 
  it was more difficult than we expected," says Wuerthele. Without a blueprint, 
  he and Kissel had to determine the order of the specimen’s bones, and also cut 
  and shape the ribs. "And we built it knowing that we’d eventually have to dismantle 
  it," Wuerthele continues, "so we used screws to attach most of the bones, instead 
  of epoxy glue." 
<P>Among the hundreds of curious onlookers who witnessed the assembly of the <i>T. 
  rex</i> cast was welder Kent Frazee. Volunteering with his own special equipment, 
  he bent and cut the steel framework onto which the specimen’s arms were then 
  attached, and saved the museum staff time and money that would have been spent 
  hiring a contractor to do the job. Frazee has a special connection to <i>T. 
  rex</i> at Carnegie Museum of Natural History, for he was once employed by Anderson 
  Welding, the company that did the welding on the museum’s original <i>T. rex</i> 
  in the 1940s. He says that a photograph of that specimen hangs on the wall at 
  Anderson headquarters. 
<P>That original <i>T. rex</i>, on exhibit in the museum’s Dinosaur Hall, will 
  be remounted in an active, horizontal position as well, when the hall is renovated 
  over the next few years. The two <i>T. rex</i> specimens will then be exhibited 
  sparring with each other in a lifelike situation. 
<P>The museum’s older <i>T. rex</i> is the type specimen—the individual on which 
  the original scientific description of <i>T. rex</i> was based, and to which 
  all others of its kind must be compared. In other words, the Carnegie’s <i>T. 
  rex</i> is the official <i>T. rex</i>, which makes it all the more important 
  for Carnegie Museum of Natural History to do right by the animal and show it 
  in a posture that reflects its lifestyle, and the latest scientific thinking.
