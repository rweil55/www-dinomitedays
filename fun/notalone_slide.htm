      <p>Most of a shark's 
        skeleton is made of cartilage (like the material in the bridge of your 
        nose). Cartilage is softer than bone, and it is less likely to become 
        a fossil. The hard parts of an animal are the most likely to become a 
        fossil--the bones and teeth. We feel lucky to have this shark fossil!

        it was a powerful swimmer. The large openings you see in the shell made 
        it possible for the turtle to be very large without extra weight. The
