	<em>Allosaurus</em> was one of the biggest meat-eating dinosaurs alive during the
	late Jurassic period (about 150 million years ago). <em>Allosaurus</em> weighed 
	much less than the huge plant-eating dinosaurs it fed on, but it 
	had a huge mouth and curved teeth up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. The front and 
	back of each of <em>Allosaurus'</em> teeth were lined with tiny serrations like 
	a steak knife. With these teeth, <em>Allosaurus</em> could slice through skin and 
	flesh with ease.
	<p>Footprints left by <em>Allosaurus</em> show it walked on powerful hind 
	limbs, taking six-and-one-half-foot strides. <em>Allosaurus'</em> powerful leg 
	muscles also allowed it to leap at its victims.</b></font>
