          <b><font size="+1">BACKGROUNDER:</font></b> <b><i><br>

          About Dinosaur Hall</i></b> </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Recently 

          named the "Sixth Best Place in the World to See Dinosaurs" by Discovery.com 

          and "One of the Best Dinosaur Collections in the United States" by Forbes.com, 

          Carnegie Museum of Natural History's Dinosaur Hall features 15 dinosaur 

          skeletons of the following species: <i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Apatosaurus</i>, 

          <i>Camarasaurus</i>, <i>Camptosaurus</i>, <i>Coelophysis</i>, <i>Corythosaurus</i>, 

          <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i>, <i>Dryosaurus</i>, <i>Edmontosaurus</i>, 

          <i>Protoceratops</i>, <i>Stegosaurus</i>, <i>Triceratops</i>, <i>Tyrannosaurus 

          rex</i>, and the flying reptile <i>Quetzalcoatlus northropi</i> (the 

          largest flying animal ever) </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">What 

          makes the hall truly unique is that the majority of its dinosaur specimens 

          are the genuine article-actual dinosaur fossils. Most dinosaurs viewed 

          at museums around the world are casts constructed out of plastic or 

          metal. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Adjacent 

          to the hall, visitors can watch as museum specialists work in <i>PaleoLab</i>, 

          where fossils that are millions of years old are prepared for scientific 

          research and public display. In another adjacent area, visitors of all 

          ages can unearth fossil casts of dinosaur and prehistoric mammals in 

          the popular <i>Bonehunter's Quarry</i>. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Skeletons 

          from the Jurassic period (150 years ago) are situated at the entrance 

          of Dinosaur Hall. The first dinosaurs that visitors encounter upon entering 

          the hall are <i>Allosaurus</i>, a large meat-eater with a huge mouth, 

          strong sharp teeth, short arms and clawed fingers, and <i>Stegosauru</i>s, 

          well-known for the distinctive triangular plates along its back.</font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Along 

          the right side of the wall are two plant eaters still partly in the 

          rock matrix in which they were found. <i>Dryosaurus</i> and <i>Camptosaurus</i> 

          are examples of ornithischians, the bird-hipped dinosaurs. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 

          next dinosaur that visitors encounter is the museum's most famous sauropod,<i> 

          Diplodocus carnegii</i> (Dippy), which was named for Andrew Carnegie 

          and for which Carnegie built Dinosaur Hall. Once considered the longest 

          animal ever to walk the Earth, it was the first dinosaur collected by 

          the museum in 1899 and is the "type specimen" by which all other dinosaurs 

          of its species are evaluated. Casts of this animal were sent to 12 museums 

          in Europe, North America, and South America, making it one of the most 

          famous dinosaurs in the world. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Standing 

          across from Dippy is a very similar-looking dinosaur called <i>Apatosaurus 

          louisae</i> (formerly called Brontosaurus), a species named for Andrew 

          Carnegie's wife, Louise, and the "type specimen" by which all dinosaurs 

          of its species are evaluated. More massive than its contemporary<i> 

          Diplodocus</i>, it may have weighed 30 to 35 tons when alive. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Another 

          specimen of sauropod is on the right wall. Still partially in its rock 

          matrix, the juvenile <i>Camarasaurus</i> is about two-fifths the size 

          of an adult and is the most complete sauropod ever unearthed. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Dominating 

          the hall is <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>. Many visitors are surprised to 

          learn that this specimen is the first<i> T. rex</i> ever discovered 

          and is the "type specimen" for the species by which all other <i>T. 

          rex </i>dinosaurs are evaluated. This specimen was discovered in 1902. 

          </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Situated 

          on the same platform with <i>T. rex</i> is a <i>Triceratops </i>skull, 

          a dinosaur that was widespread throughout western North America, and 

          <i>Protoceratops</i>, a smaller dinosaur that was discovered in Outer 

          Mongolia in 1922. <i>Protoceratops</i> is the only dinosaur in the museum's 

          collection that was found outside North America. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 

          Flanking <i>T. rex </i>is <i>Corythosaurus</i>, a crested contemporary 

          of the "Tyrant Lizard King." This animal was a plant-eater and belongs 

          to the group of dinosaurs known as "duckbilled." In addition, there 

          is another duckbill called <i>Edmontosaurus</i> on exhibit in the hall. 

          </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On 

          the hall's balcony is the newest dinosaur added to the collection and 

          one of the earliest dinosaurs. <i>Coelophysis</i> was a small carnivorous 

          dinosaur. It was about 7 feet (2.5m) long and was very light, weighing 

          between 40 and 50 pounds (18 to 23 kg). <i>Coelophysis</i> had a long, 

          slender neck, tail and hind legs, and a long narrow head. It had many 

          sharp teeth used to capture and eat other small reptiles. <i>Coelophysis</i> 

          could run very fast on its hind legs. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Dinosaurs 

          are not the only animals represented in the hall. On the left side and 

          rear wall of the hall are Mesozoic fossils from the museum's Bayet Collection. 

          Purchased in 1903 from a private collector, these are spectacular specimens 

          of other animals, vertebrates, and invertebrates that lived at the same 

          time as the dinosaurs, including several pterosaurs, the flying reptiles, 

          and large sea creatures. </font></P>
