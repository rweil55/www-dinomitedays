          </font></b><i>The History of Vertebrate Paleontology at Carnegie Museum 

          of Natural History </i> </P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 

          collection and exhibition of fossil vertebrates at Carnegie Museum of 

          Natural History dates to the museum's grand opening in 1895, when it 

          exhibited a giant Irish elk purchased from the British Museum of Natural 

          History. Added to the display the following year was a nearly complete 

          skeleton of an American mastodon, which turned out to be a popular attraction, 

          bringing in some 500,000 visitors a year into the museum in its early 

          years. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 

          great leap forward for the vertebrate fossil collections and exhibits 

          occurred in 1898, when dinosaurs first attracted the attention of Andrew 

          Carnegie. Mr. Carnegie wrote to the museum's first director, Dr. W. 

          J. Holland, instructing him to "get one [dinosaur] for Pittsburgh." 

          In 1899, Carnegie placed funds at Holland's disposal for paleontological 

          research in the Rocky Mountain region. Jacob Wortman, the first Curator 

          of Vertebrate Paleontology at Carnegie Museum of Natural History, was 

          soon hired to search for dinosaurs in the Morrison Formation at Sheep 

          Creek, Wyoming. Later that year, Wortman discovered three specimens 

          of the sauropod <i>Diplodocus</i>, one of which was designated as the 

          "type specimen"-the specimen by which all other dinosaurs of that species 

          are evaluated-of <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i>. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Carnegie 

          Museum of Natural History's quest for dinosaurs quickly moved to Colorado, 

          where a new Curator, John Bell Hatcher-joined by Charles W. Gilmore 

          in 1901 and William H. Utterback in 1902-was soon shipping carloads 

          of fossils back to Pittsburgh. Earl Douglass joined the Carnegie paleontologists 

          in 1902. His fieldwork took him to northeastern Utah's Morrison Formation, 

          a quarry that eventually became known as Dinosaur National Monument, 

          where he discovered spectacular assemblages of dinosaur bones.</font></P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Home 

          of the Dinosaur Carnegie Museum is the home of two of the world's most 

          famous dinosaurs, <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i>, or Dippy, and <i>Tyrannosaurus 

          rex</i>. Named after Andrew Carnegie, <i>Diplodocus carnegii </i>was 

          not only the best, almost-complete dinosaur skeleton known in the 1900s, 

          but also the largest land animal known at that time. At the prompting 

          of King Edward VII of England, Andrew Carnegie instructed Holland and 

          Hatcher to create a cast of <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i> for the British 

          Museum, thus beginning an unprecedented effort by Carnegie Museum of 

          Natural History to give 10 replicas of<i> Diplodocus carnegii</i> as 

          gifts to other prominent museums in Europe and throughout North and 

          South America. Carnegie's generosity made Dippy the most celebrated 

          dinosaur of the early 20th century. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 

          1942, Carnegie Museum of Natural History purchased from the American 

          Museum of Natural History the type specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex, the 

          largest carnivore known to have ever lived on earth. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Tyrannosaurus 

          rex</i>, or <i>T. rex</i>, on exhibit in Dinosaur Hall, has inspired 

          numerous popular icons, from the children's beloved "Barney" to the 

          fearsome predator that was the star in the movie <i>Jurassic Park</i>. 

          </font></P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 

          1903, Carnegie purchased from a European private collector the Bayet 

          Collection of fossil plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. This brought 

          to the museum the Western Hemisphere's finest Jurassic pterosaurs (flying 

          reptiles) and fishes from the Bavarian Solnhofen Limestone, as well 

          as vertebrates from other famous European localities, such as Cerin 

          (Jurassic of France) and Monte Bolca (Eocene of Italy). </font></P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Early 

          exploration by the museum's vertebrate paleontologists also accumulated 

          fossil mammals from the Tertiary of Montana and Nebraska. In 1905, Curator 

          and Field Collector O. A. Peterson found rich deposits of Miocene mammals 

          in a region in western Nebraska, which is now known as Agate Springs 

          Fossil Beds National Monument. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 

          the 1930s through the 1950s, field work continued primarily in Montana 

          and Utah, where Curator J. Leroy Kay pursued Eocene and Oligocene vertebrates. 

          His many assistants, including John Burke, William Moran, John Guilday, 

          John Dorr, and John Clark, did research on a diversity of fossil vertebrateS.</font></P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A 

          Tradition of Discovery </b><br>

          In 1960, Craig Black joined the curatorial staff, reviving the museum's 

          collecting and research in the Eocene of Wyoming, an enterprise that 

          continued with Leonard Krishtalka, Richard Stucky, and current members 

          of the staff, Mary Dawson and Chris Beard. David Berman (also a current 

          member of the staff) collects and studies Paleozoic vertebrates. Quaternary 

          studies were previously pursued by John Guilday and Tony Barnosky. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overseeing 

          the scientific aspect of the museum's current expansion project is the 

          museum's team of internationally known paleontologists. Dr. Mary Dawson, 

          head curator of paleontology at the museum, is a fossil mammal expert 

          concentrating on early Tertiary faunas and the evolution of rodents 

          and rabbits. In 1981, she received the prestigious Arnold Guyot Prize, 

          awarded by the National Geographic Society in recognition of her research 

          in the Arctic, which produced fossil evidence that North America and 

          Europe were linked and shared the same animal types 45-50 million years 

          ago. In 2002, she is celebrating her 40th year at the museum. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. 

          Chris Beard was a 2000 recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship "Genius Grant" 

          for his work, which is reshaping critical debates about the evolutionary 

          and geographical origins of mammals. He is considered one of the world's 

          leading authorities on the evolution of early primates. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. 

          David Berman is the only current paleontologist on staff who has collected 

          a dinosaur for the museum, acquiring <i>Coelophysis</i> from Ghost Ranch, 

          New Mexico, in the early 1980s. In addition to his research of life 

          in the Early Permian, he is credited for correctly identifying the proper 

          skull for <i>Apatosaurus</i>, ending a century-long year argument. </font></P>

          Zhe-xi Luo is one of the world's foremost specialists in Mesozoic animals. 

          His most recent international discovery, a paperclip size mammal from 

          the Mesozoic, is the smallest known Mesozoic mammal and represents a 

          new branch on the mammalian family tree. It was featured in <i>Science</i> 

          and named one of the 100 most important scientific discoveries of 2001 

          by <i>Discover</i> magazine. He is currently working on a paper describing 

          another important early mammal discovery from 130 million years ago.
