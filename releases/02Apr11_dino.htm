          TO BECOME HOME TO WORLD'S<br>



          PREMIER DINOSAUR EXHIBITS</b> <br>



          <i>Carnegie Museum of Natural History set to expand its Dinosaur Hall, 



          <br>



          becoming the first museum in the world to showcase <br>



          "Dinosaurs in Their World." </i></font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">PITTSBURGH 



          ... Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh announced today plans to dramatically 



          expand historic Dinosaur Hall, part of Carnegie Museum of Natural History. 



          The expansion will be the museum's most significant project since Andrew 



          Carnegie built Dinosaur Hall 100 years ago to house <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i> 



          (a.k.a. "Dippy"), the first dinosaur skeleton discovered by Carnegie 



          scientists. </font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Carnegie 



          Museum of Natural History already houses one of the world's best collections 



          of dinosaur fossils, as well as one of the most extensive fossil collections 



          of mammals, invertebrates, fish, and plants from the Age of Dinosaurs. 



          The museum plans to use its collections to create a group of dynamic 



          new exhibits called <i>Dinosaurs in Their World</i>, which for the first 



          time will integrate dinosaurs into the environments of their respective 



          time periods. </font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"This 



          is an incredibly exciting time for Carnegie Museums and for western 



          Pennsylvania," said Ellsworth Brown, president of Carnegie Museums of 



          Pittsburgh. "The discovery and display of dinosaurs are rich parts of 



          our history, and they are among Andrew Carnegie's most enduring legacies 



          to Pittsburgh and the world. With this expansion, we will continue to 



          carry out his vision of serving our communities regionally, nationally, 



          and internationally by leading rather than following." </font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Our 



          collection of dinosaurs-many of which have never been seen by the public-is 



          truly a world treasure, and we are committed to using that collection 



          to become the best place in the world to see and learn about dinosaurs," 



          said Bill DeWalt, director of Carnegie Museum of Natural History. "This 



          is a project 200 million years in the making, and it will attract dinosaur 



          enthusiasts from around the world." </font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Carnegie 



          Museum of Natural History's Dinosaur Hall currently features 15 dinosaur 



          skeletons in a space originally built for one. Several of those dinosaurs 



          are among the world's most famous and most complete specimens-among 



          them, <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i>, or "Dippy," named after Andrew Carnegie, 



          and <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>, or "<i>T. rex</i>," which was the first 



          of its species ever found. </font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"<i>T. 



          rex </i>is actually closer to us in time than it is to Dippy since these 



          two species of dinosaurs roamed the earth more than 75 million years 



          apart," explained DeWalt. "Our expanded dinosaur exhibits, which will 



          consist of two halls within a newly constructed atrium, will reflect 



          this important fact-placing dinosaurs such as Dippy and T. rex in their 



          own time periods. </font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Most 



          importantly, these exhibits will play a significant role in helping 



          the museum do what it does best-educate," DeWalt said. "We welcome thousands 



          of school groups every year, and it's obvious that dinosaurs open the 



          door to science for most children. We plan on capitalizing on this by 



          using <i>Dinosaurs in Their World</i> to introduce important scientific 



          themes that recur throughout our museum, such as evolution and biological 



          diversity. </font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Even 



          incredibly strong, successful creatures like the dinosaurs can become 



          extinct if their environments are disturbed," said DeWalt. "And, even 



          though dinosaurs are no longer with us, the plants, mammals, fish, and 



          insects that surrounded them continue to evolve and create the biological 



          diversity that surrounds us today." </font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Carnegie 



          Museum of Natural History's new dinosaur exhibits will depict dinosaurs 



          in their ancient environments and focus on two distinct periods of dinosaur 



          history: the Jurassic period (150 million years ago) and the Cretaceous 



          period (65 million years ago). </font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 



          current Dinosaur Hall will be transformed into a Jurassic Hall, featuring 



          Jurassic dinosaurs that include the museum's first dinosaur, Dippy. 



          An adjacent Cretaceous Hall will be created within a dramatic, newly 



          constructed atrium, which will become the physical core of Carnegie 



          Museum of Natural History and reinforce the basic themes of the museum, 



          including biodiversity, ecology, and evolution. The hall's atrium will 



          be built by expanding into a connecting courtyard in the middle of the 



          museum. Both halls will incorporate state-of-the-art interactive displays 



          and built-in classrooms. </font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Dinosaurs 



          currently on display in Dinosaur Hall will be remounted in scientifically 



          accurate, active poses, and a number of new specimens never before exhibited 



          will be added to the new halls. </font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Carnegie 



          Museum of Natural History is assembling a team of architects and exhibits 



          designers to work with its own exhibits designers and internationally-recognized 



          paleontologists to create <i>Dinosaurs in Their World</i>. The estimated 



          cost of the expansion is $37 million, to be raised through a combination 



          of public and private funds. </font></P>



        <P align=left><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Founded 



          in 1895, Carnegie Museum of Natural History is one of the four Carnegie 



          Museums of Pittsburgh. The museum welcomes more than 450,000 visitors 



          a year and reaches another 150,000 through educational outreach programs. 



          It is the third largest repository of dinosaur fossils in the world, 



          and its total collections exceed 21 million objects, specimens, and 



          artifacts of which 50,000 are on display. </font></P>
