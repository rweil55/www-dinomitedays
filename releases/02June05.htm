        <P align=center><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Carnegie 



          Museum of Natural History gets approval for<br>



          DinoMite Days from Art Commission</b></font></P>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pittsburgh 



          … On Wednesday June 5, the Pittsburgh Art Commission voted unanimously 



          to approve <i>DinoMite Days</i>, the public display of approximately 



          a hundred dinosaurs throughout the city. The approval allows Pittsburgh 



          to be transported back to the age of dinosaurs, decorating the city 



          with the most colorful display of local artistry the region has ever 



          seen. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The art 



          commission's approval was the first and most important step in making 



          <i>DinoMite Days</i> a reality," said Dr. Bill DeWalt, Director of Carnegie 



          Museum of Natural History. "This approval guarantees this public art 



          project will be highly visible in the City of Pittsburgh. We are now 



          able to move forward to develop sponsorship levels and artists guidelines." 



          </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The event 



          will be coordinated by Carnegie Museum of Natural History with major 



          funding provided by the Laurel Foundation of Pittsburgh.<i> DinoMite 



          Days</i> will feature three dinosaur designs that will transform city 



          streets, office buildings and local gardens into a wonderful outdoor 



          public art exhibit. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We are 



          thrilled to be involved with such a fun and exciting marketing awareness 



          program that positively promotes our region to the rest of the world," 



          said Donna Panazzi, Vice President of the Laurel Foundation. "<i>DinoMite 



          Days</i> will help encourage tourism for our region, while supporting 



          the worthwhile programs of Carnegie Museum of Natural History and numerous 



          other nonprofit organizations in Western Pennsylvania." </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Modeled 



          after the public art project Cow Parade introduced in Zurich, Switzerland, 



          the concept has been successful in New York, Chicago and adapted in 



          several other North American cities. It is intended to showcase emerging 



          and established local artists, support tourism and promote regional 



          partnerships. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 



          some cities have used cows, moose and horses, dinosaurs are a natural 



          for Pittsburgh because of the preeminence of Carnegie Museum of Natural 



          History in the discovery of and scientific research on dinosaurs. Dinosaurs 



          will be a major attraction because they appeal to people of all ages. 



          </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The community-wide 



          initiative celebrates Pittsburgh's international reputation for scientific 



          innovation and world-class cultural organizations," DeWalt said. "Carnegie 



          Museum of Natural History represents both of these segments, and the 



          museum is best known internationally for its world-class dinosaur collection 



          housed at the museum." </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The three 



          dinosaur designs selected are <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>, <i>Torosaurus</i> 



          and <i>Stegosaurus</i>. Casts of these creatures will be transformed 



          into unique, colorful and even playful works of art. The dinosaurs will 



          be securely mounted and displayed at highly visible locations throughout 



          Pittsburgh and other designated locations. Each dinosaur will have a 



          plaque indicating the name of its sponsor or "sponsaur" and artist. 



          </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"<i>DinoMite 



          Days</i> is a project that will include the entire Pittsburgh community," 



          said Susie Perelman of Squirrel Hill, co-chairperson of the event. "It 



          is something that everyone - corporate, public, cultural and private 



          sectors - can participate in and have fun doing. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It will 



          also heighten awareness of the many great things Pittsburgh has to offer, 



          hopefully drawing people from all over the world and ultimately raising 



          funds for the world-class cultural organizations located in the city." 



          </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Research 



          Casting International of Toronto has been selected to design, manufacture 



          and deliver the fiberglass dinosaurs. Best known as the creators of 



          the museum's Dippy statue, situated outside the Oakland facility, Royal 



          Casting International has created dinosaur replicas for the American 



          Museum of Natural History in New York City and the Canadian Museum of 



          Nature in Ottawa. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sizes 



          of each dinosaur will vary. The <i>Tyrannosaurus rex </i>will stand 



          approximately 7' by 10'. The <i>Torosaurus</i> will be approximately 



          5.5' by 8.5' and the <i>Stegosaurus</i> will rise 5.5' by 8'. Each dinosaur 



          will be designed to be as scientifically accurate as possible, while 



          providing artists the most flexibility in their designs. All the dinosaurs 



          will be mounted on a cement base to prevent them from being removed 



          and protected with anti-graffiti materials. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Art 



          Commission's approval was the first step in transforming Pittsburgh 



          into a real-life "Jurassic Park." Later this summer, Carnegie Museum 



          of Natural History will be announcing how local artists and those wishing 



          to become sponsors can participate.</font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Artist 



          guidelines are currently being developed and will be distributed to 



          the artist community around July 1. An art jury comprised of representatives 



          from various art organizations throughout Pittsburgh will review and 



          select the artists. Once selected, the artists then will have approximately 



          four to six weeks to complete their dinosaurs. An honorarium will be 



          paid to each artist upon final completion and approval of their dinosaurs. 



          </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Different 



          sponsorship guidelines will also be available. Organizations wishing 



          to become <i>DinoMite Days</i> "sponsaurs" can contact Chris Bell, Carnegie 



          Museum of Natural History Director of Development at (412) 622-5778 



          beginning July 1. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the 



          end of the public display period, sponsors will donate their dinosaurs 



          back to DinoMite Days for auction. These dinosaurs will join several 



          other pre-selected dinosaurs that will be auctioned on October 4, 2003. 



          </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sponsors 



          can select a beneficiary to receive a percentage of the proceeds from 



          the donated dinosaurs. The remaining proceeds will benefit Carnegie 



          Museum of Natural History's public and educational programs, which reach 



          almost one million people throughout the region. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 



          the museum has recently announced a $37-million expansion and renovation 



          of its world-famous Dinosaur Hall, none of the proceeds, unless designated 



          by a sponsor, will be used for this project. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We are 



          as excited about the October 4 auction celebration as we are about the 



          public display of the dinosaurs," said DeWalt. "We expect everyone will 



          have a great time that evening while we raise a lot of money for many 



          of the region's cultural groups and organizations." </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition 



          to being fun, playful and shining the international spotlight on the 



          region, <i>DinoMite Days</i> will also benefit many local businesses. 



          Based on similar successful events in other cities, <i>DinoMite Days</i> 



          is expected to have a tremendous economic impact on the region. Chicago's 



          "Cows on Parade," for example, attracted an estimated 10 million visitors 



          to the city and added $200 million to the local economy. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This 



          is an exciting event designed to bring thousands of visitors to our 



          region and generate a significant economic impact for the city," said 



          Tinsy Lipchak, Executive Director of the Office of Cultural Tourism 



          for the Greater Pittsburgh Convention and Visitors Bureau. "We are excited 



          to be to able incorporate this fun and exciting event into our 2003 



          cultural tourism efforts." </font></p>
