          </b><i>With funding secured, Carnegie Museum of Natural History plans

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pittsburgh 

          ... Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh announced it has received state support 

          for the expansion of historic Dinosaur Hall, part of Carnegie Museum 

          of Natural History. At a 10 a.m. press conference this morning, Gov. 

          Mark Schweiker delivered $15 million of state assistance for the expansion, 

          which will be the museum's most significant project since Andrew Carnegie 

          built Dinosaur Hall 100 years ago. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is a momentous 

            day for Pittsburgh's cultural community," said Ellsworth Brown, president 

            of Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. "Our region's cultural organizations 

            are full of vitality and potential, and today, Gov. Schweiker&#8212;through 

            his vision and generosity&#8212;affirmed that vitality and enabled 

            that great potential." </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Carnegie 

          Museum of Natural History already houses one of the world's best collections 

          of dinosaur fossils, many of which have never been seen by the public," 

          said Bill DeWalt, director of Carnegie Museum of Natural History, home 

          of Dinosaur Hall. "Thanks to Gov. Schweiker's belief in our plans to 

          more fully exhibit these treasures in a dynamic new way, Pittsburgh 

          will become the best place in the world to see and learn about dinosaurs." 

          </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Carnegie Museum 

            of Natural History plans to use its world-class collections to create 

            a group of dynamic new exhibits called "Dinosaurs in Their World," 

            which for the first time will integrate dinosaurs into the environments 

            of their respective time periods. The museum's Dinosaur Hall currently 

            features 15 dinosaur skeletons in a space originally built for one. 

            Several of those dinosaurs are among the world's most famous and most 

            complete specimens&#8212;among them, <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i>, or 

            "Dippy," named after Andrew Carnegie, and <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>, 

            or "<i>T. rex</i>," which was the first of its species ever found.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Carnegie Museum 

            of Natural History's expanded dinosaur exhibits, which will occupy 

            nearly three times the space as the current Dinosaur Hall, will depict 

            dinosaurs in their ancient environments. The expansion will include 

            the creation of a dramatic atrium, which will become the physical 

            core of Carnegie Museum of Natural History and reinforce the basic 

            themes of the museum. Dinosaurs currently on display in Dinosaur Hall 

            will be remounted in scientifically accurate, active poses, and a 

            number of new specimens never before exhibited will be added to the 

            new halls. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With funding 

          secured, the project now moves to the architectural design phase. The 

          estimated cost of the expansion is $37 million. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Founded in 1895, 

            Carnegie Museum of Natural History is one of the four Carnegie Museums 

            of Pittsburgh. The museum welcomes more than 450,000 visitors a year 

            and reaches another 150,000 through educational outreach programs. 

            It is the third largest repository of dinosaur fossils in the world, 

            and its total collections exceed 21 million objects, specimens, and 

            artifacts, of which 50,000 are on display. </font></p>
