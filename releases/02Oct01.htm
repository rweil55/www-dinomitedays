                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PITTSBURGH, 
                    PA&nbsp;&#8212; A <i>Tyrannosaurus rex </i>of a dramatically 
                    different color made its &quot;DinoMite&quot; debut today. 
                    Hand-painted by artist Patricia Bellan-Gillen, the 250-pound 
                    <i>T. rex</i> is the first of 100 decorated fiberglass dinosaur 
                    replicas that will add a splash of prehistoric panache to 
                    Pittsburgh's parks, plazas and public streets. The rest of 
                    the dinosaurs will paint the town in May 2003 when DinoMite 
                    Dayssm - a once-in-a-lifetime event - premieres as the world's 
                    most colorful outdoor dino art gallery. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Standing 
                    seven-feet tall, the <i>T. rex</i> was officially hatched 
                    today outside Carnegie Museum of Natural History, which is 
                    launching DinoMite Days with major funding from the Laurel 
                    Foundation of Pittsburgh. Adults and children at the prehistoric 
                    preview were delighted when the <i>T. rex</i>, a scientifically 
                    accurate replica with artistic license, emerged from an oversized 
                    crate that kept his colorful personality under wraps. Bellan-Gillen, 
                    the first artist selected to paint a DinoMite Days original, 
                    unveiled her creation, whose theme is &quot;Connections.&quot; 
                    The green <i>T. rex</i> is decorated with animal images, such 
                    as monkeys, butterflies and crabs, and a human handprint, 
                    all connected by leafy branches and vines that cover the <i>T. 
                    rex</i> from top to bottom. The <i>T. rex</i> is located near 
                    Dippy the Dinosaur and will remain outside the museum through 
                    September 2003.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This 
                    terrific <i>T. rex</i> combines artistic expression and natural 
                    history to cast dinosaurs in a whole new light,&quot; said 
                    Susie Perelman, co-chairperson of DinoMite Days. &quot;Today 
                    starts the official countdown to DinoMite Days, a visually 
                    stunning outdoor exhibit that will entice people of all ages 
                    to discover the beauty of dinosaurs, science and art.&quot;

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Due to 
                    rising interest in the event, Perelman announced that DinoMite 
                    Days is searching for more artists who are ready for their 
                    first brush with a dinosaur. The application deadline for 
                    artists has been extended to October 15, 2002. </font></p>

                    wishing to lend their talents to DinoMite Days can access 
                    online application forms and guidelines at www.dinomitedays.org. 
                    The forms are also available at local art galleries, cultural 
                    organizations and coffee shops throughout Pittsburgh. </font></p>

                    weeks to complete their dinosaurs. </font></p>

                    a nationally acclaimed artist from Burgettstown, Pa., painting 
                    the <i>T. rex</i> was a challenging and fun project. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nature 
                    was my inspiration for this design. I wanted to convey the 
                    connections that all living things have through nature,&quot; 
                    said Bellan-Gillen. &quot;The design also plays tribute to 
                    the museum itself - to its commitment to the natural sciences 
                    and education.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fourth-grade 
                    students from Burgettstown Area Elementary School painted 
                    self-portraits that Bellan-Gillen incorporated into an urn 
                    that is attached to the <i>T. rex</i>. There was a family 
                    connection in the project - her husband, Vince Gillen - teaches 
                    the pint-sized Picassos. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Born and 
                    raised in Western Pennsylvania, Bellan-Gillen received the 
                    prestigious Dorothy L. Stubnitz Professor of Art award in 
                    2001 for her dedication and achievements as a professor of 
                    art at Carnegie Mellon University. Her paintings and prints 
                    have been featured in more than 23 solo exhibitions throughout 
                    the United States. Bellan-Gillen spent six weeks working in 
                    her Burgettstown barn-turned-studio to give her <i>T. rex</i> 
                    a personality of its own.</font></p>
