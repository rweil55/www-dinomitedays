                    August 28, 2003 - Watch out for the top-seeded dinosaur! A 
                    tennis star of a dramatically different stature is making 
                    its "DinoMite" debut at the 2003 US Open. A 250-pound <i>Stegosaurus</i> 
                    dinosaur art sculpture is serving up a splash of prehistoric 
                    panache for tennis enthusiasts.</font></font></p>

                    five-feet high and nine-feet long inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, 
                    the <i>Stegosaurus</i> themed <i>Tennisaurus</i>, is on-serve 
                    for adults and children interested in art, dinosaurs, tennis 
                    and science history. The US Open's official dinosaur is one 
                    of 100 decorated, scientifically accurate dinosaurs that are 
                    adorning the parks, plazas and streets of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 
                    for <i>DinoMite Days</i><sup>SM</sup> &#8212; a public art

                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Tennisaurus has become one of the stars of this year's US Open," said USTA Chairman of the Board and President Alan Schwartz.  "It's not only a fanciful piece of art, but a great conversation piece. Most important, we plan to have it signed by some of the most recognizable legends of our game such as Billie Jean King and Ken Rosewall.  It will be auctioned with proceeds benefiting the Carnegie Museum of Natural History's "Dinosaur Hall," and the USTA Tennis & Education Foundation, to help ensure that the benefits of sport and education never become extinct."</font></p>

                    Tennis enthusiasts and mother-daughter artists, Nellie Lou 
                    Slagle and Susie Perelman, teamed up to create a <i>DinoMite 
                    Days</i> original for the 2003 US Open. Emerging on the courts 
                    of New York, <i>Tennisaurus</i> is decked out with official 
                    tennis racquets, shoes, balls and a net. The spikes along 
                    the dinosaur's spine also are lined with tennis court terrain. 
                    The <i>Steg</i> will be on display inside the main entrance 
                    of Arthur Ashe throughout the tournament before advancing 
                    to the next round &#8212; a gala auction in Pittsburgh to 
                    raise funds for non-profit organizations. </font></p>

                    artist, I have worked with tennis and sports motifs, however, 
                    this was my first project combining a three-dimensional dinosaur 
                    with one of the world's largest sports attractions," said 
                    Susie Perelman, artist and chairperson of <i>DinoMite Days</i>. 
                    "This sculpture combines the world's timeless fascination 
                    of dinosaurs with the game of tennis in a new and colorful 
                    light, offering players a platform to show a fun side of their 
                    nature."</font>

                    be auctioned off at the event or online and half of the proceeds 
                    will benefit the expansion of Carnegie Museum of Natural History's 
                    "Dinosaur Hall," and the "sponsaur" of each dinosaur will

                    from the auctioned dinosaur. Information about how to buy
