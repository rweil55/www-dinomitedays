One hundred dinosaurs with distinct artistic personalities are being turned loose in Pittsburgh, starting tomorrow.  Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy today proclaimed the start of DinoMite Days, a once-in-a-lifetime event that will transform the city into the world's largest Jurassic art park this summer.  </font></p>

The free outdoor event features 200 to 500-pound fiberglass dinosaurs that have been meticulously decorated by artists and students.  Visitors to Pittsburgh will encounter DinoMite Days dinosaurs in public plazas, on the streets and in front of buildings.  The viewing locations will be listed on the DinoMite Days Web site, <a href="http://www.dinomitedays.org" target="top">www.dinomitedays.org</a>.   </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm proud to announce that DinoMite Days will transform Pittsburgh into 'DinoBurgh' this summer.  DinoMite Days will showcase Pittsburgh's vitality in art and science and the important mission of Carnegie Museum of Natural History, a world leader in collecting and preserving dinosaur fossils," Mayor Murphy said today in a ceremony at the City-County Building. </font></p>
                  <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Installation of the first 50 dinosaurs begins Thursday, May 29 and will be completed by Sunday, June 1, when special activities along Grant Street in Downtown Pittsburgh will celebrate the official start of DinoMite Days.

                    The Greater Pittsburgh Convention and Visitor's Bureau is promoting DinoMite Days as a unique attraction that will enthrall visitors and tourists.  </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"DinoMite Days is a creative event that makes Pittsburgh a must-see travel destination this summer for anyone who enjoys dinosaurs or art," Lipchak said.  "We expect DinoMite Days to enhance Pittsburgh's appeal to visitors."

Families can enjoy prehistoric kid-friendly activities and visit the dinosaurs by walking from USX Tower to Oxford Centre, Mellon Plaza and Liberty Center.  Other dinosaurs will be installed throughout the downtown area including Gateway Center, Fifth Avenue Place, FreeMarkets Center and PPG Place. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> "We expect people of all ages to welcome the DinoMite Days dinosaurs to Pittsburgh," DeWalt said.  "This unique event is a free, fun and enlightening cultural activity that complements our ongoing efforts to expand the museum's Dinosaur Hall." </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DinoMite Days is sponsored by Carnegie Museum of Natural History, which houses the world's third-largest collection of dinosaur fossils.  The event is being supported by major funding from the Laurel Foundation and corporate sponsorships of the dinosaurs.   </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Approximately 20 dinosaurs are still available for "sponsaurship."  Sponsors select a design, decide where the work of art will be displayed throughout the summer and choose a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization to receive half of the proceeds once the dinosaur is auctioned on October 18, 2003, at a black-tie gala event at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.  The remaining proceeds will be used for renovation and expansion of Carnegie Museum of Natural History's Dinosaur Hall.  </font></p>
